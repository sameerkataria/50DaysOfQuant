### I am going to use various resources to come up with Practise questions

Q1: Two gamblers are playing a cpomg toss game. Gambler A has n+1 coins and gambler b has n fair coins. What is the Prob that A will have more heads than B if they flip all coins

Ans: 

One way to understand the situation above is this.
You can remove the first n coins from the equation. Given the random nature of the toss, it will only depend on the extra coin that A has.
So what is the prob that the last coin turns up heads i.e. 1/2

Other way is to do it by defining events 

$E{_1}$: A's n coins have more heads than B's n coins<br>
$E{_2}$: A's n coins has equal heads as B's n coins<br>
$E{_3}$: B's n coins have more heads than A's n coins<br>

$E{_1}$ and $E{_3}$ should have the same prob say $x$ due to symmetry <br>
$P(E{_1}) = P(E{_3}) = x$<br>
Assume $P(E{_2}) = y$ <br>
So $ 2 \times x + y = 1$ <br>

For $E{_1}$, A will always have more heads on the n+1 toss. For $E{_3}$ the extreme case would be B has one more heads than A and in the last toss A gets a head. It still would not help our case. For $E{_2}$, the only case is when A turns up head on the n+1 toss and this is going to be with a probability of 1/2. 

So the Probability that A has more heads than B in n+1 toss is:

$x \times 1 + (1/2) \times y + 0 \times x$<br>
$x + (1/2) \times y = 0.5$<br>
Using the Total prob equation
